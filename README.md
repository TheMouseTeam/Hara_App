**About**

![logo]

With Hara you can:
1) Become A Volunteer: Become an active volunteer for an hour and help other people. Buy them medicines, food, do their shopping, keep company to the elderly and anything else you can think of.

2) Donate Blood: Give 30' of your time and become a blood donor. With Hara, you can find out about the blood donation events in the hospitals nearby.

3) Organise Charity Events: Learn about charity events in your town organised by our partners / organisations. Contact our partners and organise an event in your area on their behalf and with their support. 

Our philosophy: Hara is the Greek word Χαρά for happiness. The happiness to become a volunteer, to bring joy to others and help others. The chance to do more, to give more, to love more, to live more. Even in uncertain times, there are no limits to the compassion and solidarity. It’s what makes us humans after all. Volunteerism is a form of love rooted in the idea that a better future is always possible. This is our philosophy and it is reflected on our logo, the Bluebird: a symbol of happiness in many cultures around the world.
